# Learn-Data-Science-wk2

For the second week meetup, we will be taking a closer look at using some of the functionality within Python for analyzing a dataset.  We will be:

* Using pandas to understand a dataset of interest.
* Using matplotlib to perform EDA.
* Using statsmodels to fit a linear regression model.
* Interpret the results of your linear regression model.
